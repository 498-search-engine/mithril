# Querying, Ranking, and Constraint Solving

## Testing End-to-End

There are various `*_driver` executables testing various components of the constraint solving and query compiling. All of these CLIs have help messages if you run them with no arguments.

To test the system fully, run `manager_driver`. Again, reference the help message. In general, it takes in index directory source(s) and spawns a worker(s) to serve those queries in an interactive terminal session.

```bash
$ manager_driver {idx1 path} {idx2 path} ...
```

You ***must*** run it from the `bin` directory for ranking to work.

Warning: memory-mapping can take a good minute.

Here is an example:

```bash
‚ï≠‚îÄuser ~/docs/mithril  ‚Äπmain‚Ä∫
‚ï∞‚îÄ‚û§ cd bin/
‚ï≠‚îÄuser ~/docs/mithril/bin  ‚Äπmain‚Ä∫
‚ï∞‚îÄ‚û§ ../build/query/manager_driver path/to/idx

You can then enter queries just like in the web page frontend, though you may need to escape some special characters to deal with UNIX shell behaviour.

For example:

```bash
>> cat AND dog
